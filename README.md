Real-time 3D graphics rendering engine from scratch except the part where i use sdl2. Has vertex editing and animation caching (e.g., sculpt facial expressions and save them as reusable animations)

Supports multiple 3D objects via scene graph hierarchy. Cool camera too. 

Definitely a work-in-progress passion project. Currently adding CUDA acceleration, trying to optimize performance for larger models

like any 3d engine, at certain angles, the geometry will look very weird.
